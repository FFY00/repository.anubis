# Anubis Repo
This is my Kodi repository. If you have any requests just let me know in the [Issues section](https://github.com/FFY00/repository.anubis/issues).

#### How to use?
Download the latest .zip file from the [Releases tab](https://github.com/FFY00/repository.anubis/releases) and install it. After that, "Anubis Repo" will be avaliable in Kodi's Addon Manager.

##### How to install the .zip file?
Go to the Kodi's Addon Manager (different for each skin) > Install from ZIP, then you just select the .zip file you downloaded previously (you can use a pendrive or something like that if you have a TV Box/Raspberry PI/Other Single-board Computer).
